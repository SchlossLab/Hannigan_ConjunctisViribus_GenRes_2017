To the editors of PLOS Computational Biology:

We resubmit for your review: "Biogeography & environmental conditions shape bacteriophage & bacteria interaction networks across the human microbiome" by Geoffrey Hannigan and colleagues. We appreciate the comments that the reviewers in the previous round of review made regarding our work and we feel that incorporating their suggestions into the manuscript has significantly enhanced the work.

Our lab strives to set high standards of reproducibility and transparency, while generating and publishing high quality data. As such, all analysis work-flows, scripts, and datasets have been made publicly available for other researchers to utilize. The results presented in this manuscript are original and the manuscript is not under consideration elsewhere. A preprint version of this manuscript has been made available through BioRxiv (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/144642). All authors have read and approve the manuscript for publication.

We thank you for your consideration and look forward to your response.
