\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and
play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has
relied on studying microbes and viruses independently, thereby reducing
them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture
how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that
maintain community stability or allow phage-host populations to
co-evolve. We developed and implemented a network-based analytical
approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the
human body. We accomplished this by building a machine learning
algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given
microbiome. This algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial
metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts.
We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to
evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We found
that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not
conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets and obesity
were associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed
between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being
less connected and more prone to instability. This study quantified and
contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human
body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence
phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for
future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as
disease states, through ecological networks.

\section{Importance}\label{importance}

The human microbiome, the collection of microbial communities that
colonize the human body, is a crucial component to health and disease.
Two major components to the human microbiome are the bacterial and viral
communities. These communities have primarily been studied separately
using metrics of community composition and diversity. These approaches
have failed to capture the complex dynamics of interacting bacteria and
phage communities, which frequently share genetic information and work
together to maintain stable ecosystems. Removal of bacteria or phage can
disrupt or even collapse those ecosystems. Relationship-based network
approaches allow us to capture this interaction information. Using this
network-based approach with three independent human cohorts, we were
able to present an initial understanding of how phage-bacteria networks
differ throughout the human body, so as to provide a baseline for future
studies of how and why microbiome networks differ in disease states.

\newpage

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and
play important roles in health and disease. Bacterial communities have
been associated with disease states, including a range of skin
conditions (1), acute and chronic wound healing conditions (2, 3), and
gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (4, 5),
\emph{Clostridium difficile} infections (6) and colorectal cancer (7,
8). Altered human viromes (virus communities consisting primarily of
bacteriophages) also have been associated with diseases and
perturbations, including inflammatory bowel disease (5, 9), periodontal
disease (10), spread of antibiotic resistance (11), and others (12--17).
Viruses act in concert with their microbial hosts as a single ecological
community (18). Viruses influence their living microbial host
communities through processes including lysis, host gene expression
modulation (19), influence on evolutionary processes such as horizontal
gene transfer (22) or antagonistic co-evolution (26), and alteration of
ecosystem processes and elemental stoichiometry (27).

Previous human microbiome work has focused on bacterial and viral
communities, but have reduced them to two separate communities by
studying them independently (5, 9, 10, 12--17). This approach fails to
capture the complex dynamics of interacting bacteria and phage
communities, which frequently share genetic information and work
together to maintain stable ecosystems. Removal of bacteria or phage can
disrupt or even collapse those ecosystems (18, 28--37).
Relationship-based network approaches allow us to capture this
interaction information. Studying such bacteria-phage interactions
through community-wide networks built from inferred relationships could
offer further insights into the drivers of human microbiome diversity
across body sites and enable the study of human microbiome network
dynamics overall.

In this study, we characterized human-associated bacterial and phage
communities by their inferred relationships using three published paired
virus and bacteria-dominated whole community metagenomic datasets (13,
14, 38, 39). We leveraged machine learning and graph theory techniques
to establish and explore the human bacteria-phage network diversity
therein. This approach built upon previous large-scale phage-bacteria
network analyses by inferring interactions from metagenomic datasets,
rather than culture-dependent data (33), which is limited in the scale
of possible experiments and analyses. Our metagenomic interaction
inference model improved upon previous models of phage-host predictions
that have utilized a variety of techniques, such as linear models to
predict bacteria-phage co-occurrence using taxonomic assignments (40),
and nucleotide similarity models that were applied to both whole virus
genomes (41) and related clusters of whole and partial virus genomes
(42). Our approach uniquely included protein interaction data and was
validated based on experimentally determined positive and negative
interactions (i.e.~who does and does not infect whom). Through this
approach we were able to provide a basic understanding of the network
dynamics associated with phage and bacterial communities on and in the
human body. By building and utilizing a microbiome network, we found
that different people, body sites, and anatomical locations not only
support distinct microbiome membership and diversity (13, 14, 38, 39,
43--45), but also support ecological communities with distinct
communication structures and propensities toward community instability.
Through an improved understanding of network structures across the human
body, we empower future studies to investigate how these communities
dynamics are influenced by disease states and the overall impact they
may have on human health.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Cohort Curation and Sample
Processing}\label{cohort-curation-and-sample-processing}

We studied the differences in virus-bacteria interaction networks across
healthy human bodies by leveraging previously published shotgun sequence
datasets of purified viral metagenomes (viromes) paired with
bacteria-dominated whole community metagenomes. Our study contained
three datasets that explored the impact of diet on the healthy human gut
virome (14), the impact of anatomical location on the healthy human skin
virome (13), and the viromes of monozygotic twins and their mothers (38,
39). We selected these datasets because their virome samples were
subjected to virus-like particle (VLP) purification. To this end, they
employed combinations of filtration, chloroform/DNase treatment, and
cesium chloride gradients to eliminate organismal DNA and thereby allow
for direct assessment of both the extracellular and fully-assembled
intracellular virome \textbf{(Supplemental Figure \ref{SequenceStats}
A-B)} (14, 39). While the whole metagenomic shotgun sequence samples
were not subjected to purification, they primarily consisted of bacteria
(13, 14, 38, 39).

The bacterial and viral sequences from these studies were quality
filtered and assembled into contigs. We further grouped the related
bacterial and phage contigs into operationally defined units based on
their k-mer frequencies and co-abundance patterns, similar to previous
reports \textbf{(Supplemental Figure \ref{ContigStats} -
\ref{ClusterStats})} (42). We referred to these operationally defined
groups of related contigs as operational genomic units (OGUs). Each OGU
represented a genomically similar sub-population of either bacteria or
phages. Contig lengths within clusters ranged between \(10^{3}\) and
\(10^{5.5}\) bp \textbf{(Supplemental Figure \ref{ContigStats} -
\ref{ClusterStats})}.

\subsection{Evaluating the Model to Predict Phage-Bacteria
Interactions}\label{evaluating-the-model-to-predict-phage-bacteria-interactions}

We predicted which phage OGUs infected which bacterial OGUs using a
random forest model trained on experimentally validated infectious
relationships from six previous publications (41, 47--51). Only bacteria
and phages were used in the model. The training set contained 43 diverse
bacterial species and 30 diverse phage strains, including both broad and
specific ranges of infection \textbf{(Supplemental Figure
\ref{ValidationOverview} A - B)}. Phages with linear and circular
genomes, as well as ssDNA and dsDNA genomes, were included in the
analysis. Because we used DNA sequencing studies, RNA phages were not
considered \textbf{(Supplemental Figure \ref{ValidationOverview} C-D)}.
This training set included both positive relationships (a phage infects
a bacterium) and negative relationships (a phage does not infect a
bacterium). This allowed us to validate the false positive and false
negative rates associated with our candidate models, thereby building
upon previous work that only considered positive relationships (41).

Four phage and bacterial genomic features were used in a random forest
model to predict infectious relationships between bacteria and phages:
1) genome nucleotide similarities, 2) gene amino acid sequence
similarities, 3) bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) spacer sequences that target phages, and 4)
similarity of protein families associated with experimentally identified
protein-protein interactions (52). The resulting random forest model was
assessed and the area under its receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve was 0.846, the model sensitivity was 0.829, and specificity was
0.767 \textbf{(Figure \ref{RocCurve} A)}. The most important predictor
in the model was amino acid similarity between genes, followed by
nucleotide similarity of whole genomes \textbf{(Figure \ref{RocCurve}
B)}. Protein family interactions were moderately important to the model,
and CRISPRs were largely uninformative, due to the minimal amount of
identifiable CRISPRs in the dataset and their redundancy with the
nucleotide similarity methods \textbf{(Figure \ref{RocCurve} B)}.
Approximately one third of the training set relationships yielded no
score and therefore were unable to be assigned an interaction prediction
\textbf{(Figure \ref{RocCurve} C)}.

We used our random forest model to classify the relationships between
bacteria and phage operational genomic units, which were then used to
build the interactive network. The master network contained the three
studies as sub-networks, which themselves each contained sub-networks
for each sample \textbf{(Figure \ref{RocCurve} D)}. Metadata including
study, sample ID, disease, and OGU abundance within the community were
stored in the master network for parsing in downstream analyses
\textbf{(Supplemental Figure \ref{NetworkDiagram})}. The master network
was highly connected and contained 72,287 infectious relationships among
578 nodes, representing 298 phages and 280 bacteria. Although the
network was highly connected, not all relationships were present in all
samples. As relationships were weighted by the relative abundances of
their associated bacteria and phages, lowly abundant relationships could
be present but not highly abundant. Like the master network, the skin
network exhibited a diameter of 4 (measure of graph size; the greatest
number of traversed vertices required between two vertices) and included
99.7\% and 99.8\% of the master network nodes and edges, respectively
\textbf{(Figure \ref{RocCurve} E - F)}. The phages and bacteria in the
gut diet and twin sample sets were more sparsely related: each contained
fewer than 150 vertices, fewer than 20,000 relationships, and diameters
of 3 \textbf{(Figure \ref{RocCurve} E - F)}.

\subsection{Role of Diet \& Obesity in Gut Microbiome
Connectivity}\label{role-of-diet-obesity-in-gut-microbiome-connectivity}

Diet is a major environmental factor that influences resource
availability and gut microbiome composition and diversity, including
bacteria and phages (14, 53, 54). Previous work in isolated
culture-based systems has suggested that changes in nutrient
availability are associated with altered phage-bacteria network
structures (30), although this has yet to be tested in humans. We
therefore hypothesized that a change in diet would also be associated
with a change in virome-microbiome network structure in the human gut.

We evaluated the diet-associated differences in gut virome-microbiome
network structure by quantifying how central each sample's network was
on average. We accomplished this by utilizing two common centrality
metrics: degree centrality and closeness centrality. Degree centrality,
the simplest centrality metric, was defined as the number of connections
each phage made with each bacterium. We supplemented measurements of
degree centrality with measurements of closeness centrality. Closeness
centrality is a metric of how close each phage or bacterium is to all of
the other phages and bacteria in the network. A higher closeness
centrality suggests that the effects of genetic information or altered
abundance would be more impactful to all other microbes in the system. A
network with higher average closeness centrality also indicates an
overall greater degree of connections, which suggests a greater
resilience against instability. We used this information to calculate
the average connectedness per sample, which was corrected for the
maximum potential degree of connectedness.

We found that the gut microbiome network structures associated with
high-fat diets were less connected than those of low-fat diets
\textbf{(Figure \ref{dietnetworks} A-B)}. Tests for statistical
differences were not performed due to the small sample size. High-fat
diets exhibited reduced degree centrality \textbf{(Figure
\ref{dietnetworks} A)}, suggesting bacteria in high-fat environments
were targeted by fewer phages and that phage tropism was more
restricted. High-fat diets also exhibited decreased closeness centrality
\textbf{(Figure \ref{dietnetworks} B)}, indicating that bacteria and
phages were more distant from other bacteria and phages in the
community. This would make genetic transfer and altered abundance of a
given phage or bacterium less capable of impacting other bacteria and
phages within the network.

In addition to diet, obesity was found to influence network structure.
Obesity-associated networks demonstrated a higher degree centrality
\textbf{(Figure \ref{dietnetworks} C)}, but less closeness centrality
than the healthy-associated networks \textbf{(Figure \ref{dietnetworks}
D)}. These results suggested that the obesity-associated networks are
less connected, having microbes further from all other microbes within
the community.

\subsection{Individuality of Microbial
Networks}\label{individuality-of-microbial-networks}

Skin and gut community membership and diversity are highly personal,
with people remaining more similar to themselves than to other people
over time (13, 55, 56). We therefore hypothesized that this personal
conservation extended to microbiome network structure. We addressed this
hypothesis by calculating the degree of dissimilarity between each
subject's network, based on phage and bacteria abundance and centrality.
We quantified phage and bacteria centrality within each sample graph
using the weighted eigenvector centrality metric. This metric defines
central phages as those that are highly abundant (\(A_{O}\) as defined
in the methods) and infect many distinct bacteria which themselves are
abundant and infected by many other phages. Similarly, bacterial
centrality was defined as those bacteria that were both abundant and
connected to numerous phages that were themselves connected to many
bacteria. We then calculated the similarity of community networks using
the weighted eigenvector centrality of all nodes between all samples.
Samples with similar network structures were interpreted as having
similar capacities for maintaining stability and transmitting genetic
material.

We used this network dissimilarity metric to test whether microbiome
network structures were more similar within people than between people
over time. We found that gut microbiome network structures clustered by
person (ANOSIM p-value = 0.005, R = 0.958, \textbf{Figure \ref{intradiv}
A}). Network dissimilarity within each person over the 8-10 day sampling
period was less than the average dissimilarity between that person and
others, although this difference was not statistically significant
(p-value = 0.125, \textbf{Figure \ref{intradiv} B}). The lack of
statistical confidence was likely due to the small sample size of this
dataset. Although there was evidence for gut network conservation among
individuals, we found no evidence for conservation of gut network
structures within families. The gut network structures were not more
similar within families (twins and their mothers; intrafamily) compared
to other families (inter-family) (p-value = 0.312, \textbf{Figure
\ref{intradiv} C}). In addition to the gut, skin microbiome network
structure was strongly conserved within individuals (p-value \textless{}
0.001, \textbf{Figure \ref{intradiv} D}). This distribution was similar
when separated by anatomical sites. Most sites were statistically
significantly more conserved within individuals \textbf{(Supplemental
Figure \ref{allskin})}.

\subsection{Association Between Environmental Stability and Network
Structure Across the Human Skin
Landscape}\label{association-between-environmental-stability-and-network-structure-across-the-human-skin-landscape}

Extensive work has illustrated differences in diversity and composition
of the healthy human skin microbiome between anatomical sites, including
bacteria, virus, and fungal communities (13, 44, 55). These communities
vary by degree of skin moisture, oil, and environmental exposure. As
viruses are known to influence microbial diversity and community
composition, we hypothesized that microbe-virus network structure would
be specific to anatomical sites, as well. To test this, we evaluated the
changes in network structure between anatomical sites within the skin
dataset.

The average centrality of each sample was quantified using the weighted
eigenvector centrality metric. Intermittently moist skin sites (dynamic
sites that fluctuate between being moist and dry) were significantly
less connected than the more stable moist and sebaceous environments
(p-value \textless{} 0.001, \textbf{Figure \ref{skinnetwork} A)}. Also,
skin sites that were occluded from the environment were much more highly
connected than those that were constantly exposed to the environment or
only intermittently occluded (p-value \textless{} 0.001, \textbf{Figure
\ref{skinnetwork} B)}.

To supplement this analysis, we compared the network signatures using
the centrality dissimilarity approach described above. The dissimilarity
between samples was a function of shared relationships, degree of
centrality, and bacteria/phage abundance. When using this supplementary
approach, we found that network structures significantly clustered by
moisture, sebaceous, and intermittently moist status \textbf{(Figure
\ref{skinnetwork} C,E)}. Occluded sites were significantly different
from exposed and intermittently occluded sites, but there was no
difference between exposed and intermittently occluded sites
\textbf{(Figure \ref{skinnetwork} D,F)}. These findings provide further
support that skin microbiome network structure differs significantly
between skin sites.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Foundational work has provided a baseline understanding of the human
microbiome by characterizing bacterial and viral diversity across the
human body (13, 14, 43--45, 57). Here, we offer an initial understanding
of how phage-bacteria networks differ throughout the human body, so as
to provide a baseline for future studies of how and why microbiome
networks differ in disease states. We developed and implemented a
network-based analytical model to evaluate the basic properties of the
human microbiome through bacteria and phage relationships, instead of
membership or diversity alone. This enabled the application of network
theory to provide a new perspective on complex ecological communities.
We utilized metrics of connectivity to model the extent to which
communities of bacteria and phages interact through mechanisms such as
horizontal gene transfer, modulated bacterial gene expression, and
alterations in abundance.

Just as gut microbiome and virome composition and diversity are
conserved in individuals (13, 43, 44, 56), gut and skin microbiome
network structures were conserved within individuals over time. Gut
network structure was not conserved among family members. These findings
suggested that the community properties inferred from microbiome
interaction network structures, such as stability, the potential for
horizontal gene transfer between members, and co-evolution of
populations, were person-specific. These properties may be impacted by
personal factors ranging from the body's immune system to external
environmental conditions, such as climate and diet.

The ability of environmental conditions to shape gut and skin microbiome
interaction network structure was further supported by our finding that
diet and skin location were associated with altered network structures.
We found evidence that diet was sufficient to alter gut microbiome
network connectivity. Although our sample size was small, our findings
provided evidence that high-fat diets were less connected than low-fat
diets and that high-fat diets therefore may lead to less stable
communities with a decreased ability for microbes to directly influence
one another. We supported this finding with the observation that obesity
may have been associated with decreased network connectivity. Together
these findings suggest the food we eat may not only impact which
microbes colonize our guts, but may also impact their interactions with
infecting phages. Further work will be required to characterize these
relationships with a larger cohort.

In addition to diet, the skin environment also influenced the microbiome
interaction network structure. Network structure differed between
environmentally exposed and occluded skin sites. The sites under greater
environmental fluctuation and exposure (the exposed and intermittently
exposed sites) were less connected and therefore were predicted to have
a higher propensity for instability. Likewise, intermittently moist
sites demonstrated less connectedness than the more stable moist and
sebaceous sites. Together these data suggested that body sites under
greater degrees of fluctuation harbored less connected, potentially less
stable microbiomes. This points to a link between microbiome and
environmental stability and warrants further investigation.

While these findings take us an important step closer to understanding
the microbiome through interspecies relationships, there are caveats to
and considerations regarding the approach. First, as with most
classification models, the infection classification model developed and
applied is only as good as its training set -- in this case, the
collection of experimentally-verified positive and negative infection
data, where genomes of all members are fully sequenced. Large-scale
experimental screens for phage and bacteria infectious interactions that
report high-confidence negative interactions (i.e., no infection) are
desperately needed, as they would provide more robust model training and
improved model performance. Furthermore, just as we have improved on
previous modeling efforts, we expect that new and creative scoring
metrics will be integrated into this model to improve future
performance.

Second, although our analyses utilized the best datasets currently
avilable for our study, this work was done retrospectively and relied on
existing data up to seven years old. These archived datasets were
limited by the technology and costs of the time. For example, the diet
and twin studies, relied on multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in
their library preparations--an approach used to overcome the large
nucleic acids requirements typical of older sequencing library
generation protocols. It is now known that MDA results in biases in
microbial community composition (58), as well as toward ssDNA viral
genomes (59, 60), thus rendering the resulting microbial and viral
metagenomes largely non-quantitative. Future work that employs larger
sequence datasets and that avoids the use of bias-inducing amplification
steps will build on and validate our findings, as well as inform the
design and interpretation of further studies.

Finally, the networks in this study were built using operational genomic
units (OGUs), which represented groups of highly similar bacteria or
phage genomes or genome fragments as clustered sub-populations. Similar
clustering definition and validation methods, both computational and
experimental, have been implemented in other metagenomic sequencing
studies, as well (42, 61--63). These approaches could offer yet another
level of sophistication to our network-based analyses. While this
operationally defined clustering approach allows us to study whole
community networks, our ability to make conclusions about interactions
among specific phage or bacterial species or populations is inherently
limited. Future work must address this limitation, e.g., through
improved binning methods and deeper metagenomic shotgun sequencing, but
most importantly through an improved conceptual framing of what defines
ecologically and evolutionarily cohesive units for both phage and
bacteria (64). Defining operational genomic units and their taxonomic
underpinnings (e.g., whether OGU clusters represent genera or species)
is an active area of work critical to the utility of this approach. As a
first step, phylogenomic analyses have been performed to cluster
cyanophage isolate genomes into informative groups using shared gene
content, average nucleotide identity of shared genes, and pairwise
differences between genomes (65). Such population-genetic assessment of
phage evolution, coupled with the ecological implications of genome
heterogeneity, will inform how to define nodes in future iterations of
the ecological network developed here.

Together our work takes an initial step towards defining bacteria-virus
interaction profiles as a characteristic of human-associated microbial
communities. This approach revealed the impacts that different human
environments (e.g., the skin and gut) can have on microbiome
connectivity. By focusing on relationships between bacterial and viral
communities, they are studied as the interacting cohorts they are,
rather than as independent entities. While our developed bacteria-phage
interaction framework is a novel conceptual advance, the microbiome also
consists of archaea and small eukaryotes, including fungi and
\emph{Demodex} mites (1, 66)--all of which can interact with human
immune cells and other non-microbial community members (67). Future work
will build from our approach and include these additional community
members and their diverse interactions and relationships (e.g., beyond
phage-bacteria). This will result in a more robust network and a more
holistic understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes that
drive the assembly and function of the human-associated microbiome.

\section{Materials \& Methods}\label{materials-methods}

\subsection{Code Availability}\label{code-availability}

A reproducible version of this manuscript written in R markdown and all
of the code used to obtain and process the sequencing data is available
at the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/SchlossLab/Hannigan\_ConjunctisViribus\_mSystems\_2017

\subsection{Data Acquisition \& Quality
Control}\label{data-acquisition-quality-control}

Raw sequencing data and associated metadata were acquired from the NCBI
sequence read archive (SRA). Supplementary metadata were acquired from
the same SRA repositories and their associated manuscripts. The gut
virome diet study (SRA: \texttt{SRP002424}), twin virome studies (SRA:
\texttt{SRP002523}; \texttt{SRP000319}), and skin virome study (SRA:
\texttt{SRP049645}) were downloaded as \texttt{.sra} files. Sequencing
files were converted to \texttt{fastq} format using the
\texttt{fastq-dump} tool of the NCBI SRA Toolkit (v2.2.0). Sequences
were quality trimmed using the Fastx toolkit (v0.0.14) to exclude bases
with quality scores below 33 and shorter than 75 bp (68). Paired end
reads were filtered to exclude sequences missing their corresponding
pair using the \texttt{get\_trimmed\_pairs.py} script available in the
source code.

\subsection{Contig Assembly}\label{contig-assembly}

Contigs were assembled using the Megahit assembly program (v1.0.6) (69).
A minimum contig length of 1 kb was used. Iterative k-mer stepping began
at a minimum length of 21 and progressed by 20 until 101. All other
default parameters were used.

\subsection{Contig Abundance
Calculations}\label{contig-abundance-calculations}

Contigs were concatenated into two master files prior to alignment, one
for bacterial contigs and one for phage contigs. Sample sequences were
aligned to phage or bacterial contigs using the Bowtie2 global aligner
(v2.2.1) (70). We defined a mismatch threshold of 1 bp and seed length
of 25 bp. Sequence abundance was calculated from the Bowtie2 output
using the \texttt{calculate\_abundance\_from\_sam.pl} script available
in the source code.

\subsection{Operational Genomic Unit
Binning}\label{operational-genomic-unit-binning}

Contigs often represent large fragments of genomes. In order to reduce
redundancy and the resulting artificially inflated genomic richness
within our dataset, it was important to bin contigs into operational
units based on their similarity. This approach is conceptually similar
to the clustering of related 16S rRNA sequences into operational
taxonomic units (OTUs), although here we are clustering contigs into
operational genomic units (OGUs) (57).

Contigs were clustered using the CONCOCT algorithm (v0.4.0) (71).
Because of our large dataset and limits in computational efficiency, we
randomly subsampled the dataset to include 25\% of all samples, and used
these to inform contig abundance within the CONCOCT algorithm. CONCOCT
was used with a maximum of 500 clusters, a k-mer length of four, a
length threshold of 1 kb, 25 iterations, and exclusion of the total
coverage variable.

OGU abundance (\(A_{O}\)) was obtained as the sum of the abundance of
each contig (\(A_{j}\)) associated with that OGU. The abundance values
were length corrected such that:

\[ { A }_{ O }=\frac { { 10 }^{ 7 }\sum _{ j=1 }^{ k }{ { A }_{ j } }  }{ \sum _{ j=1 }^{ k }{ { L }_{ j } }  } \]

Where \texttt{L} is the length of each contig \texttt{j} within the OGU.

\subsection{Phage OGU Identification}\label{phage-ogu-identification}

To confirm a lack of phage sequences in the bacterial OGU dataset, we
performed blast nucleotide alignment of the bacterial OGU representative
sequences using an e-value \textless{} \(10^{-25}\), which was stricter
than the \(10^{-10}\) threshold used in the random forest model below.
We used a stricter threshold because we know there are genomic
similarities between bacteria and phage OGUs from the interactive model,
but we were interested in contigs with high enough similarity to
references that they may indeed be from phages. 2\% of the OGUs had
nucleotide similarities to known bacteriophage genomes, although the
alignments were short (a couple of kb) and represented a small fraction
of the alignment sequences.

\subsection{Open Reading Frame
Prediction}\label{open-reading-frame-prediction}

Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using the Prodigal program
(V2.6.2) with the meta mode parameter and default settings (72).

\subsection{Classification Model Creation and
Validation}\label{classification-model-creation-and-validation}

The classification model for predicting interactions was built using
experimentally validated bacteria-phage infections or validated lack of
infections from six studies (41, 47--51). Associated reference genomes
were downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute (see details
in source code). The model was created based on the four metrics listed
below.

The four scores were used as parameters in a random forest model to
classify bacteria and bacteriophage pairs as either having infectious
interactions or not. The classification model was built using the Caret
R package (v6.0.73) (73). The model was trained using five-fold cross
validation with ten repeats. Pairs without scores were classified as not
interacting. The model was optimized using the ROC value. The resulting
model performance was plotted using the plotROC R package.

\subparagraph{Identify Bacterial CRISPRs Targeting
Phages}\label{identify-bacterial-crisprs-targeting-phages}

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) were
identified from bacterial genomes using the PilerCR program (v1.06)
(74). Resulting spacer sequences were filtered to exclude spacers
shorter than 20 bp and longer than 65 bp. Spacer sequences were aligned
to the phage genomes using the nucleotide BLAST algorithm with default
parameters (v2.4.0) (75). The mean percent identity for each matching
pair was recorded for use in our classification model.

\subparagraph{Detect Matching Prophages within Bacterial
Genomes}\label{detect-matching-prophages-within-bacterial-genomes}

Temperate bacteriophages infect and integrate into their bacterial
host's genome. We detected integrated phage elements within bacterial
genomes by aligning phage genomes to bacterial genomes using the
nucleotide BLAST algorithm and a minimum e-value of 1e-10. The resulting
bitscore of each alignment was recorded for use in our classification
model.

\subparagraph{Identify Shared Genes Between Bacteria and
Phages}\label{identify-shared-genes-between-bacteria-and-phages}

As a result of gene transfer or phage genome integration during
infection, phages may share genes with their bacterial hosts, providing
us with evidence of phage-host pairing. We identified shared genes
between bacterial and phage genomes by assessing amino acid similarity
between the genes using the Diamond protein alignment algorithm
(v0.7.11.60) (76). The mean alignment bitscores for each genome pair
were recorded for use in our classification model.

\subparagraph{Protein - Protein
Interactions}\label{protein---protein-interactions}

The final method used for predicting infectious interactions between
bacteria and phages was the detection of pairs of genes whose proteins
are known to interact. We assigned bacterial and phage genes to protein
families by aligning them to the Pfam database using the Diamond protein
alignment algorithm. We then identified which pairs of proteins were
predicted to interact using the Pfam interaction information within the
Intact database (52). The mean bitscores of the matches between each
pair were recorded for use in the classification model.

\subsection{Interaction Network
Construction}\label{interaction-network-construction}

The bacteria and phage operational genomic units (OGUs) were scored
using the same approach as outlined above. The infectious pairings
between bacteria and phage OGUs were classified using the random forest
model described above. The predicted infectious pairings and all
associated metadata were used to populate a graph database using Neo4j
graph database software (v2.3.1) (77). This network was used for
downstream community analysis.

\subsection{Centrality Analysis}\label{centrality-analysis}

We quantified the centrality of graph vertices using three different
metrics, each of which provided different information graph structure.
When calculating these values, let \(G(V,E)\) be an undirected,
unweighted graph with \(|V|=n\) nodes and \(|E|=m\) edges. Also, let
\(\mathbf{A}\) be its corresponding adjacency matrix with entries
\(a_{ij} = 1\) if nodes \(V_i\) and \(V_j\) are connected via an edge,
and \(a_{ij} = 0\) otherwise.

Briefly, the \textbf{closeness centrality} of node \(V_i\) is calculated
taking the inverse of the average length of the shortest paths
(\texttt{d}) between nodes \(V_i\) and all the other nodes \(V_j\).
Mathematically, the closeness centrality of node \(V_i\) is given as:

\[ { C }_{ C }\left( { V }_{ i } \right) ={ \left( \sum _{ j=1 }^{ n }{ d\left( { V }_{ i },{ V }_{ j } \right)  }  \right)  }^{ -1 } \]

The distance between nodes (\texttt{d}) was calculated as the shortest
number of edges required to be traversed to move from one node to
another.

Intuitively, the \textbf{degree centrality} of node \(V_i\) is defined
as the number of edges that are incident to that node:

\[ { C }_{ D }\left( { V }_{ i } \right) =\sum _{ j=1 }^{ n }{ { a }_{ ij } } \]

where \(a_{ij}\) is the \(ij^{th}\) entry in the adjacency matrix
\(\mathbf{A}\).

The eigenvector centrality of node \(V_i\) is defined as the \(i^{th}\)
value in the first eigenvector of the associated adjacency matrix
\(\mathbf{A}\). Conceptually, this function results in a centrality
value that reflects the connections of the vertex, as well as the
centrality of its neighboring vertices.

The \textbf{centralization} metric was used to assess the average
centrality of each sample graph \(\mathbf{G}\). Centralization was
calculated by taking the sum of each vertex \(V_{i}\)'s centrality from
the graph maximum centrality \(C_{w}\), such that:

\[ C\left( G \right) =\frac { \sum _{ i=1 }^{ n }{ Cw -c\left( { V }_{ i } \right)  }  }{ { T } }  \]

The values were corrected for uneven graph sizes by dividing the
centralization score by the maximum theoretical centralization
(\texttt{T}) for a graph with the same number of vertices.

Degree and closeness centrality were calculated using the associated
functions within the igraph R package (v1.0.1) (78).

\subsection{Network Relationship
Dissimilarity}\label{network-relationship-dissimilarity}

We assessed similarity between graphs by evaluating the shared
centrality of their vertices, as has been done previously. More
specifically, we calculated the dissimilarity between graphs \(G_{i}\)
and \(G_{j}\) using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric and eigenvector
centrality values such that:

\[ B\left( { G }_{ i },{ G }_{ j } \right) =1-\frac { 2{ C }_{ ij } }{ { C }_{ i }+{ C }_{ j } } \]

Where \(C_{ij}\) is the sum of the lesser centrality values for those
vertices shared between graphs, and \(C_{i}\) and \(C_{j}\) are the
total number of vertices found in each graph. This allows us to
calculate the dissimilarity between graphs based on the shared
centrality values between the two graphs.

\subsection{Statistics and
Comparisons}\label{statistics-and-comparisons}

Differences in intrapersonal and interpersonal network structure
diversity, based on multivariate data, were calculated using an analysis
of similarity (ANOSIM). Statistical significance of univariate
Eigenvector centrality differences were calculated using a paired
Wilcoxon test.

Statistical significance of differences in univariate eigenvector
centrality measurements of skin virome-microbiome networks were
calculated using a pairwise Wilcoxon test, corrected for multiple
hypothesis tests using the Holm correction method. Multivariate
eigenvector centrality was measured as the mean differences between
cluster centroids, with statistical significance measured using an ANOVA
and post hoc Tukey test.
