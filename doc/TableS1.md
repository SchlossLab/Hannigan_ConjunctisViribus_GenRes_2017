   Diet & the Gut Virome     Minot, 2011    • 16S rRNA gene qPCR revealed reduction in bacterial DNA of at least 10,000X.

                                            • Alignment of shotgun sequences revealed 35X reduction in 16S rRNA gene alignments in virome compared to bacteria shotgun.

                                            • Electron microscopy and nucleic acid stain techniques visually confirmed lack of bacteria in virome samples.

   Skin Virome             Hannigan, 2015    • Significant reduction in reads mapping to 16S rRNA gene sequence, compared to bacteria shotgun dataset.

                                             • Significant reduction in reads mapping to human genome, compared to bacteria shotgun dataset.

                                             • Average viral relative abundance of 0.4% in bacterial shotgun dataset.

  Twin Gut Virome           Reyes, 2010      • Confirmation that 2.5% of bacterial shotgun reads mapped to virome, and 76% of virome reads matched the shotgun 2.5%.
